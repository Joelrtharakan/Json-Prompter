- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)

## Architecture Patterns
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Context API for global state management
- Utility functions for JSON manipulation and validation
- Service layer for data operations

## Key Features to Focus On
- JSON schema builder with drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time preview and validation
- Template library management
- Export/Import functionality (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Dynamic architecture configuration
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Dependencies
- React with TypeScript
- JSON Schema validation libraries
- UI component libraries (like Ant Design or Material-UI)
- Code editor components (like Monaco Editor)
- File handling utilities
