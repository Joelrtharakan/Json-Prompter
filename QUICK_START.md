# Quick Start Guide

## Single Command Startup

You no longer need to run the frontend and backend separately! Use any of these methods:

### Method 1: NPM Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run start
```

### Method 2: Alternative NPM Script
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

### Method 3: Shell Script
```bash
./start.sh
```

## What happens when you run these commands:

- âœ… **Backend Server** starts on `http://localhost:3001`
- âœ… **Frontend Server** starts on `http://localhost:5173`
- âœ… **Both run simultaneously** with colored output to distinguish them
- âœ… **Automatic restart** if you make changes to the code

## Individual Server Commands (if needed):

- Backend only: `npm run dev:backend`
- Frontend only: `npm run dev:frontend`

## Stopping the Servers:

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop both servers at once.
